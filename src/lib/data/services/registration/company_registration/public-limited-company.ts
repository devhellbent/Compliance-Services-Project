  overview: `**Public Limited Company Registration**

A public limited company is a business structure that can offer shares to the general public through a stock exchange. Unlike a private limited company, it has no restriction on the number of members and a minimum of seven shareholders and three directors is required for registration. It is regulated by the Companies Act, 2013 and is a separate legal entity with perpetual succession and limited liability for its members.

To register, the company must file an electronic application with the Registrar of Companies, including the Memorandum and Articles of Association, and obtain a certificate of incorporation. A key requirement is the issuance of a prospectus to the public for inviting subscriptions to its shares. Due to its public nature, it is subject to more stringent regulations, reporting requirements, and transparency norms compared to a private limited company.
