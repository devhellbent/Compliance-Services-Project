  overview: `**Private Limited Company Registration**

**Private Limited Company Registration** is the legal process of forming a **private company** under the **Companies Act, 2013** in India. A **Private Limited Company (Pvt. Ltd.)** is a business structure that provides **limited liability protection** to its shareholders and a **separate legal identity** from its owners.

This type of company is ideal for startups, small-to-medium businesses, and growing enterprises because it allows easy **fundraising**, offers **better credibility**, and provides a strong foundation for scaling up operations.

**What is Private Limited Company?**

A private limited company (Pvt. Ltd.) is a type of business structure that is privately held and owned by a small group of stakeholders. In India, it is defined and regulated by the Companies Act, 2013. This business structure is a popular choice for startups and small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) because it combines the benefits of a corporate structure with a degree of privacy and operational flexibility.

A private limited company is a business structure that is a separate legal entity from its owners, offering the key benefit of limited liability. This means the personal assets of the shareholders are protected and are not at risk for the company's debts.`,
