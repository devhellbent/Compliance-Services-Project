    "Bridge the financial inclusion gap with purpose-driven lending. Microfinance Company registration enables provision of small-scale financial services to underserved communities, promoting entrepreneurship and economic empowerment at the grassroots level.",
  overview: `**What Is Microfinance Company?**

A **Microfinance Company (MFC)**, also known as a Microfinance Institution (MFI), is a financial entity dedicated to providing financial services to low-income individuals, households, and small businesses that are typically excluded from traditional banking services

**Key Definition and Role:**

-   **Financial Inclusion:** Their primary function is to promote financial inclusion by bridging the gap left by conventional banks, which often do not find it economically viable to offer small, collateral-free loans.

-   **Target Population:** They specifically target the \"unbanked\" or \"underserved\" populations, particularly in rural or marginalized communities, including women and micro-entrepreneurs.

-   **Services Offered:** While they are best known for **microcredit** (small loans, often under a specified limit like ₹1 lakh in India), their services also include:

-   **Savings and Checking Accounts**

-   **Micro-insurance** (e.g., health or life insurance)

-   **Financial and Business Education** (Financial literacy programs)

-   **Fund Transfers/Remittances**

Microfinance Company Registration in India can be done in two ways: **NBFC-MFI** (regulated by RBI) and **Section 8 Company** (regulated by MCA).

**NBFC-MFI** is suitable for larger lending operations. It requires a minimum capital of ₹5 crore (₹2 crore for North Eastern states), incorporation as a Private or Public Limited Company, and RBI approval. At least 85% of loans must be given to low-income groups, with specific income and loan limits prescribed by RBI. The process involves company incorporation, capital infusion, bank account opening, and applying to RBI for a Certificate of Registration. This process may take 3--6 months.

**Section 8 Microfinance Company** is a simpler option for NGOs or small lending activities. It does not require RBI approval or high capital. It is registered under the Companies Act as a non-profit entity and can provide microloans from grants or own funds but cannot accept public deposits.`,
