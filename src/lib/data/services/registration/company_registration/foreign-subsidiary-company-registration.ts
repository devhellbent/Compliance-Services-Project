  overview: `**Foreign subsidiary company registration**

Establishing a foreign subsidiary is a comprehensive process that allows a foreign company (the parent or holding company) to establish a legal entity in another country (the host country), with the parent company retaining more than 50% ownership and control.

Since the registration process is heavily governed by the local laws of the host country, the following explanation outlines the general steps and requirements, using India as a common example jurisdiction.

## **What is a Foreign Subsidiary Company?** 

A foreign subsidiary is a local company incorporated in the host country, but whose majority of the share capital (more than 50%) is held by a foreign corporation. This arrangement makes the foreign corporation the **Parent** or **Holding Company**, and the local company its **Subsidiary**.

The key feature is that the subsidiary is treated as a separate legal entity under the host country's laws (e.g., an Indian Private Limited Company under the Companies Act, 2013, in India), even though its control lies with the foreign parent.

**Set Up Your Subsidiary in India**

Setting up a foreign subsidiary in India is a strategic move for global expansion, offering a host of significant advantages. The top reasons for establishing a subsidiary in India revolve around its massive market potential, strong talent pool, legal benefits, and cost efficiencies.

Here are the top reasons to set up your subsidiary in India:

      text: "The drawbacks are primarily related to the complexity, cost, and compliance burden of operating a full-fledged local entity. **1. High Setup and Operational Costs:** The initial process is capital-intensive, involving significant costs for legal fees, company registration, stamp duties, and meeting any mandated minimum capital requirements. Ongoing operational costs, including dedicated office space and hiring a full local staff, are also substantial. **2. Complex and Time-Consuming Setup:** Incorporation is often a lengthy administrative process that requires meticulous paperwork, notarization/apostille of foreign documents, and compliance with various regulatory bodies (e.g., Registrar of Companies, Tax Authorities, Foreign Exchange Regulators). **3. Burden of Local Compliance:** The subsidiary must comply with **all** local corporate laws, labor laws, tax regulations, and foreign exchange regulations (such as FEMA). This requires constant monitoring and the hiring of specialized local legal and accounting professionals, adding to the administrative overhead. **4. Exposure to Local Market Risks:** The subsidiary is fully exposed to the host country\\'s political instability, adverse changes in government policy, economic downturns, and currency fluctuation risks, which can significantly impact its profitability. **5. Transfer Pricing Complexity:** Transactions between the parent company and the subsidiary (e.g., sales of components, intellectual property fees, management charges) are scrutinized under strict Transfer Pricing regulations. Failure to comply can result in heavy penalties and additional tax liabilities. **6. Difficulty in Closure/Liquidation:** If the business venture fails, winding up or dissolving a registered subsidiary is a complex, long, and expensive legal procedure that requires numerous clearances and regulatory filings. **Eligible criteria of Foreign Subsidiary Company Registration** A Foreign Subsidiary Company in India is primarily registered as a **Private Limited Company** under the Companies Act, 2013. The eligibility hinges on meeting the statutory requirements for forming such a company and complying with India\\'s Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy.
