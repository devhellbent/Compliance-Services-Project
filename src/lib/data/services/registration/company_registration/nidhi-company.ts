    "Foster financial inclusion through mutual cooperation. Nidhi Company registration enables member-focused savings and lending operations, promoting thrift habits and providing accessible credit facilities within a regulated mutual benefit framework.",
  overview: `**Nidhi Company Registration**

A Nidhi Company is a type of Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) governed by Section 406 of the Companies Act, 2013 and Nidhi Rules, 2014.Its primary objective is to cultivate the habit of saving and thrift among its members and to accept deposits and lend money only to its members. Nidhi Companies operate on a mutual benefit principle and do not require RBI approval for registration, making them an attractive option for small savings and lending operations.

To register a Nidhi Company, a minimum of seven members is required, out of which three must be directors. The company must be incorporated as a Public Limited Company with "Nidhi Limited" as part of its name. The minimum paid-up share capital required is ₹10 lakhs. After incorporation, within one year, the company must have at least 200 members and a Net Owned Fund (NOF) of ₹20 lakhs.

The registration process involves obtaining Digital Signature Certificates (DSC), Director Identification Numbers (DIN), name approval through RUN (Reserve Unique Name), and filing incorporation forms with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA).

**What is Nidhi Company?**

The main objective of a **Nidhi Company** is to **promote a culture of savings and financial discipline** among a specific group of members.
