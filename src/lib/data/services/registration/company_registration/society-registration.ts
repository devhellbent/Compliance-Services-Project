    "Build lasting social impact through collective action. Society registration establishes membership-based non-profit organizations for charitable, literary, scientific, and artistic pursuits, creating democratic platforms for community-driven change and social welfare initiatives.",
  overview: `**What is Society Registration?**

Society Registration, governed in India by the **Societies Registration Act, 1860**, is the legal process of formally registering a group of individuals (minimum seven) who have united for a non-profit, common goal.

The primary purpose is to grant a collective a separate legal identity (distinct from its members) to promote objectives such as charitable aid, education, science, fine arts, or social welfare.

Registration is crucial as it provides:

-   **Legal Recognition** to own property, enter contracts, and sue or be sued in its own name.

-   **Credibility and Trust** for fundraising and receiving government grants.

-   **Perpetual Succession**, ensuring the society continues regardless of changes in membership.

The process involves drafting a **Memorandum of Association** and Rules and Regulations, which are then submitted to the Registrar of Societies.

**Types of Society Registration in India**

In India, society registration is primarily governed by the **Societies Registration Act, 1860**, which is a central act adopted by most states (often with amendments).

The Act does not divide registration into formal *types* but specifies the broad **purposes** for which a society can be formed. Therefore, the \"types\" are defined by their core objective as stated in their Memorandum of Association.

The main categories eligible for registration include societies formed for the promotion of:

1.  **Literary or Scientific Purposes:**

-   For example, research institutions, science clubs, and academic associations.

2.  **Charitable Purposes:**

-   Societies for poverty relief, welfare of the underprivileged, or general public good.

3.  **Fine Arts or the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge:**

-   Examples include cultural associations, music or drama groups, and vocational training centers.

4.  **Other Specific Purposes mentioned in Section 20 of the Act:**

-   Foundation or maintenance of libraries, public museums, or galleries.

-   Diffusion of political education (in the context of governance/civic awareness).`,
