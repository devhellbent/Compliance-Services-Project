    "**Provident Fund (PF) Registration** is a mandatory social security scheme for employers, governed by the **Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO)**. Its purpose is to provide employees with retirement savings. Under this scheme, both the employer and the employee contribute a certain percentage of the employee's salary each month. This corpus provides a financial cushion for employees upon retirement. ðŸ’°",
