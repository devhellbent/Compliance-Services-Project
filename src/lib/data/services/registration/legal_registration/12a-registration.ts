  overview:
    "**12A Registration** is a one-time registration granted by the Income Tax Department to non-profit organizations like Trusts, Societies, and Section 8 Companies. ðŸ“œ Its primary purpose is to provide the NGO with **complete tax exemption** on its surplus income. Without 12A registration, an NGO's income would be subject to normal tax rates, just like any other commercial entity.",
