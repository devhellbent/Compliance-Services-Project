    "Accredited ISO certification audits for QMS/EMS/OH&S/ISMS/FSMS with a 3‑year cycle and annual surveillance.",
  overview:
    `**ISO Registration in India** is a certification process that ensures a company's products, services, and management systems meet international standards set by the **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)**. It helps businesses improve quality, safety, and efficiency while enhancing customer satisfaction and global credibility.

By obtaining ISO certification, companies demonstrate their commitment to maintaining consistent quality and operational excellence. It also helps them gain a competitive edge in both domestic and international markets. Common ISO standards include **ISO 9001** for Quality Management, **ISO 14001** for Environmental Management, and **ISO 27001** for Information Security.`,

However, to successfully achieve certification, an organization must meet certain fundamental requirements related to its structure, documentation, and operational systems.    Here is the detailed elaboration of the five ISO registration eligibility criteria for an Indian business, focusing on a clear, descriptive format:"

            "**Focus on Process:** The ISO audit looks at *how* you run your operations (your processes), not *what type* of legal structure you have. The standard scales itself to fit your organizational complexity and size."

        title: "Legal Existence of the Business",

            "**Documentation in Practice:** This goes beyond writing down procedures. You need to show **records and evidence** (like log sheets, inspection reports, or training attendance records) demonstrating that your team has been following these documented processes for a reasonable period (often 1-3 months). The auditor checks if the documented steps match the actual work being done."

            "**Review and Action:** The company must demonstrate that it formally **reviews the system's performance** (a \\'Management Review\\') and takes **corrective actions** whenever an issue or non-compliance is identified. This commitment to continuous cycle of improvement is essential."
