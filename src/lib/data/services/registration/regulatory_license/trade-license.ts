  overview:
    "A **Trade License** is a certificate issued by a local municipal corporation that grants permission to carry out a specific business or trade in a particular area. ðŸ“œ Its primary purpose is to ensure that the business complies with the local authority's rules and safety guidelines. It doesn't grant property ownership but is a mandatory permit to operate a business from a specific premise. The rules and regulations for obtaining a trade license vary from state to state.",
