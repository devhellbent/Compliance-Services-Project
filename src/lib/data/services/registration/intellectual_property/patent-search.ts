  overview:
    "A **Patent Search**, also known as a **Prior Art Search**, is a systematic search of existing patents and other publicly available documents (like scientific papers) to determine if an invention is new (**novel**) and non-obvious. üîç It is a **critical first step** before investing significant time and money in drafting and filing a patent application. The search helps in assessing the patentability of an invention and in drafting a strong application.",
