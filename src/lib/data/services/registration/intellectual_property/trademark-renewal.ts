  overview:
    "**Trademark Renewal** is the process of extending the validity of a registered trademark for another **10 years**. üóìÔ∏è A trademark registration is not perpetual and must be renewed before its expiry to maintain legal protection and the exclusive rights associated with the brand. Failing to renew on time can lead to the removal of the trademark from the register, leaving your brand vulnerable.",
