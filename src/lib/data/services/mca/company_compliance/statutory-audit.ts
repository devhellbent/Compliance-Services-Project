  overview:
    "A **Statutory Audit** is a legally required, independent examination of a company's financial statements and records. üßê Its primary purpose is to express an opinion on whether the financial statements provide a **'true and fair' view** of the company's financial position and are free from material misstatement. The audit is conducted by a qualified, independent **Chartered Accountant (CA)** and is mandated by laws like the Companies Act, 2013.",
